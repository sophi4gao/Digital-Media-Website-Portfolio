    <p>Reflection:</p>
    <p>For this project I used Replit to create a website for my Digital Media Portfolio. I learned how to do basic coding and use HTML/CSS. While creating my website I was inspired by some images I saw on pinterest and I also tried to incorporate some of the things I like (such as the colors and fonts). Although I tried doing the best of my abilities, I obviously wasn‚Äôt able to make my visions a reality since we only learned the basics of coding. Some things that I enjoyed was making the website itself because it was fun to just play around with it and create an actual functioning website. However some things were difficult to understand and I wasn‚Äôt sure on how to add some things.
    Although it was pretty fun, I had a difficult time just trying to figure out how everything worked and getting the hang of it. Something I wanted to add were buttons that would bring me to a different page or function in some way but I wasn‚Äôt able to figure out how to. Even though I liked creating the website, I wouldn‚Äôt see myself as a front end developer because it is still pretty difficult for me to manage. Overall it was a fun experience creating websites. </p>
